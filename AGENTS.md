# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Frontend tasks

When doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into "AI slop" or safe, average-looking layouts.
Aim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.
-use shadcn ui components and tailwind css as much as possible this is very important for the project import needed components from shadcn ui! 
- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).
- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. Avoid default purple-heavy SaaS gradients unless explicitly requested.
- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.
- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.
- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.
- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile
- Finish the website or app to completion, within the scope of what's possible without adding entire adjacent features or services. It should be in a working state for a user to run and test.

Exception: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.

# Plan tool

When using the planning tool:
- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).
- Do not make single-step plans.
- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.
- Unless asked for a plan, never end the interaction with only a plan. Plans guide your edits; the deliverable is working code.
- Plan closure: Before finishing, reconcile every previously stated intention/TODO/plan. Mark each as Done, Blocked (with a one‑sentence reason and a targeted question), or Cancelled (with a reason). Do not end with in_progress/pending items. If you created todos via a tool, update their statuses accordingly.
- Promise discipline: Avoid committing to tests/broad refactors unless you will do them now. Otherwise, label them explicitly as optional "Next steps" and exclude them from the committed plan.
- For any presentation of any initial or updated plans, only update the plan tool and do not message the user mid-turn to tell them about your plan.

# Presenting your work and final message

You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.

- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.
- Format: Use natural language with high-level headings.
- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.
- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.
- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.
- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.
- No "save/copy this file" - User is on the same machine.
- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.
- For code changes:
  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with "summary", just jump right in.
  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.
  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.
- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.
